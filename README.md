## Questions (10 Points)

1. Define HTTP and why it's important.
hypertext transfer protocol is the set of rules and procedures that are used by web pages on the internet. HTTP is important because if each web page followed a different set of rules a user would need to have the corresponding rules for any web page they'd like to visit while if they all agree anyone can use any web page. HTTP is the set that we have all agreed to use.
2. Using [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) Create a diagram of the request and response cycle when a user visits turing.edu. Include clear labels for all components. Put the link to your drawing below. (3 points possible)

3. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.
the two main parts of the HTTP request are the branch and the verb. The branch tells the server at the desired URL which file in the website's file tree needs to be accessed for the given request. The verb is what the request will do with the given web page, whether its GET to have the web page's file sent back or POST where the server needs to take the file sent on the request.
4. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.
HTML is the content on the web page while CSS is how the content is presented in the browser.
5. How can the chrome dev tools help with writing html and css?
dev tools allow you to open the HTML and CSS files for a website and both look at them to see what is going on behind the scenes as well as tinker with the page's code in a temporary way to test ideas before implementing them in the actual file.
6. How do you open the chrome dev tools?
there are several ways to open the dev tools my preferred way is to right-click on the website and select "Inspect".
7. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?
using semantic HTML tags allows you to be more specific and organized while saving specificity by creating an extra level of specific types. You also no longer need to give a class to a div so you can still add a class to a semantic tag when needed.
8. What are the three components of the box model?
padding is the space between the edge of the background the edge of the content. the border is the next level around the padding. and the outermost component is the margin giving space between elements.
